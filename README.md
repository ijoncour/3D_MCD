# 3D_MCD
Compute with a robust covariance method the best gaussian 3D ellipsoid that fits the enveloppe of a 3D spatial distribution of stars. We build our script in R environment using a bootstrap technique and the Minimum Covariant Determinant (MCD) method included in the MASS package for the spatial analysis.
